# Reward Pools

### Overview

Reward Pools are the backbone of SwanFiâ€™s staking ecosystem, designed to incentivize participation and align stakeholder interests. These pools distribute rewards to users based on their contributions to the network, such as staking Swan tokens or providing computational resources. The system ensures fair, transparent, and sustainable rewards, driving liquidity and growth within the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) ecosystem.

### Key Features

#### 1. Dynamic Reward Distribution

* Rewards are calculated daily and distributed based on user participation.
* Adjustments are made dynamically to align with Total Value Locked (TVL) performance metrics and baseline targets.

#### 2. Tokenized Participation

* Users receive tokenized representations of their contributions, such as fSwan tokens, which accumulate rewards over time.

#### 3. Sustainability Mechanisms

* Reward pools are capped to ensure long-term sustainability.
* Fees and dynamic multipliers encourage balanced growth and participation.

### Types of Reward Pools

#### 1. OP Reward Pool

* **Purpose**: Incentivize users to stake Swan tokens by distributing OP tokens.
* **Mechanics**:
  * Rewards are based on TVL performance relative to baseline targets.
  * Daily rewards are capped to ensure sustainable distribution.
  * Users earn OP tokens proportional to their stake.

#### 2. Swan Staking Pool

* **Purpose**: Share revenue from computing operators with Swan token stakers.
* **Mechanics**:
  * Users stake Swan tokens and receive fSwan tokens as proof of their stake.
  * Rewards are distributed from the revenue generated by computing operators.
  * A 10% platform fee is applied only to staking rewards, not the principal.

### Benefits

#### For Users:

* **Passive Income**: Earn rewards from staking and shared revenue.
* **Liquidity**: Tokenized rewards (e.g., fSwan) can be traded or held for future gains.
* **Flexibility**: Users can unstake with minimal impact on their principal.

#### For the Ecosystem:

* **Increased Participation**: Incentivizes broader adoption of staking and compute resource sharing.
* **Sustainable Growth**: Aligns rewards with network performance and contributions.
* **Enhanced Liquidity**: Drives token activity and engagement in DePIN projects.

### Future Developments

1. **Multi-Asset Reward Pools**:
   * Enable rewards in multiple tokens beyond OP and Swan to diversify incentives.
2. **Dynamic Reward Structures**:
   * Introduce tiered rewards to incentivize long-term staking and higher contributions.
3. **Governance Integration**:
   * Allow users to influence reward pool configurations through community governance.
4. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   * Provide transparent dashboards showing reward pool performance and user earnings.
